Here is the beginning of a Pacman game. We'll see how our game evolves as I immerse myself into coding.
 
<h2>Description</h2>
Using setInterval and several key variables, we are able to change the image of Pacman from open mouth to closed mouth and see it progress across the screen within the width of your browser.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To see Pacman successfully moving horizontally within your web page, you will need to find 4 images and name them Pacman1, Pacman2, Pacman3, and Pacman4. The images should be of Pacman with an open mouth to the right, Pacman with a closed mouth to the right, Pacman with an open mouth to the left, and Pacman with a closed mouth to the left, respectively. Download those images into the same folder with the .html file and the .js file. Double click on the .html file and Pacman should be running across your screen opening and closing its mouth, back and forth.

<h2>Usage</h2>
One way to use these files is as a start to the actual Pacman game. In order to get started, you'll need a Pacman with a chomp and later you can make it change directions and go off screen.

<h2>Support</h2>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>:
Later I am hoping to improve my code so that I can create at least one or two levels of Pacman, the game.
